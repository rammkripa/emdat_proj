# emdat_proj
Project for EMDAT data

## India and Sri Lanka
I added a R markdown document where I use the data in the .xlsx file in this repo.
It contains EMDAT data from India and Sri Lanka for all years.
I have tried to narrow it down to Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka, so as to be of more use to the analysis of NE Monsoons

## Brazil
